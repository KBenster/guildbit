"Traditional VOIP hosts offer subscription-based and persistent servers, "

"        is charged. <strong>GuildBit</strong> works on the idea of "
"temporary servers to preserve system\n"
"        resources, opening up more server slots which aren&apos;t being "
"occupied. This helps lower hosting,\n"
"        resources and bandwidth costs. Also, VPS hosting nowadays are "
"much cheaper than they used to be. The\n"
